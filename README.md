- 👋 Hi, I’m @borg-developer (AKA ilPirata and more formally Martin Thompson)
- 👀 I’m interested in science (physics, astronomy and cosmology) and technology (HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, React, Bootstrap)
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning software development using a more modern set of tools and platforms, so I am somewhere beginner and intermediate, but I love to learn by doing, so please, please reach out to me
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything as i really want to get a broad range of technical skills in as wide as range of market spaces
- 📫 You can reach me martin.thompson@neoit.me
